Salisbury, UK--(March 16, 2021) - Impactasaurus, an impact monitoring and reporting tool, is recognised by Theo Paphitis and becomes a winner of his #SBS competition.

Dan Reynolds, founder of Impactasaurus, entered into the Small Business Sunday competition and was one of six weekly winners to gain a retweet by Theo to his near half a million Twitter followers, and join his prestigious #SBS club. The weekly initiative, set up by Theo in 2010, supports small businesses in the UK.

Dan Reynolds said: "We have been helping charities demonstrate their social impact for 5 years now and it is great to have been recognised by Theo as one of the UK's most promising small businesses. We appriecate his support in sharing Impactasaurus with his followers and look forward to supporting even more charities as a result."

Small business champion and Ryman Stationery, Robert Dyas and Boux Avenue Chairman, Theo Paphitis, said: "We are thrilled to welcome new #SBS members every week and highlight just how important it is to support our small businesses here in the UK. My vision is that everyone who has ever won an #SBS re-tweet from me becomes part of a friendly club; like-minded individuals who can share successes and learnings. The website will also give a valuable profile to the winners chosen and I wish Impactasaurus every success."

Impactasaurus is a free, easy to use website which lets charities measure, monitor and report on their social impact. It is used by hundreds of charities around the world to secure more funding and drive improvements to their services. It takes just a few minutes to get started, includes a catalogue of questionnaires to select from and fully supports remote service delivery.
