Measuring social impact is normally undertaken to attract funding.
But it can also be a driver for positive change within your organisation.
To unlock this potential, you must avoid vanity metrics.

_Vanity metrics_ is a term used in the startup world.
It describes any metric which does not relate to the business' goals and cannot be used to inform decisions.
Perfect examples include website views and social media followers.
Increasing website views may make you feel good, but it does not measure a business goal and does not offer any guidance on what to do or change to improve.

In social impact, the vanity metrics to avoid are your organisation's outputs.
_Outputs_ detail what your charity has done or produced. 
For example, how many interventions or workshops you have conducted.
Outputs are easy to measure and are important in understanding your impact as they describe your reach.
However, they are not ideal for learning and improvement as they rarely relate to your goals.
I have yet to meet a charity whose goal was to run workshops, they are just the chosen medium for achieving social change.

To illustrate the point, consider a charity which performed 100 workshops last year.
With this metric, all we can say is that the charity conducted 100 workshops.
This metric does not provide any information we can use to help drive improvements.
Nor does it tell us that the workshops helped towards our organisation's goals.
It simply says that we did stuff.

To assess change, you must first understand how well the goals of your organisation are being achieved.
Remember, change is not always beneficial, without monitoring your performance, a change could be detrimental.
Once performance monitoring is available, changes can be made and their effect on your performance observed.
Metrics which tie actions to observed results are called _actionable metrics_.
To improve as an organisation, you must measure actionable metrics related to your organisation's goals.

_Outcomes_ describe the result of your organisation's efforts.
For example, the improvements to a beneficiary's well-being as a result of your intervention.
If the outcomes being measured relate to your organisation's goals, there is scope to learn and improve.
There are many tools available to help define outcomes which contribute towards your goals.
Theory of change is a popular tool, which maps from programs or initiatives, to outcomes and finally your long term-goals.
By following this process, improvements to your outcomes should mean you are improving your ability to achieve your goals.

To be able to learn from your outcomes, you must understand what actions affect them.
For example, if we introduce a new intervention, did it outperform the status quo?
To be able to answer this, your outcome measurement and reporting must be capable of reporting on different segments of your data.
Segments are a subset of your data which have similar attributes.
In this example, we could segment our data based on the type of intervention, allowing us to compare the new intervention to the incumbent.
With this capability, organisations can innovate quickly by trialing new approaches and assessing their performance.

To improve as a sector, we must take a leaf from the startup world and focus on actionable metrics.
In the case of social impact, measuring outcomes which are defined based on your goals is a great start.
The next step is to make them actionable, by understanding how your actions affect your outcomes.

Impactasaurus is a simple tool for outcome measuring and reporting.
Data within Impactasaurus can be tagged, allowing reports to be generated for different segments.
