Sure, most charities measure social impact to attract funding.
But it can also be a driver for positive change in your charity.
To unlock this potential, you must measure the right metrics.

Social impact is often seen as a counting game. 
Many charities have impact reports full of quantities: the number of interventions, the number of workshops conducted and the amount of donations received.
The startup world has a term for such stats - vanity metrics. 
Vanity metrics, might make you feel good, but they donâ€™t offer clear guidance on what to do.

Say you performed 100 workshops last year, now what?
Do you know that the workshops produced the desired results?
How can you improve the workshops?
Does performing more workshops achieve your organisation's long-term goals?

To assess change, you must first understand how well the goals of your organisation are being achieved.
Remember, change is not always beneficial, without monitoring your performance, a change could be detrimental.
Once performance monitoring is available, changes can be made and their effect on your performance observed.
Metrics which tie actions to observed results are called actionable metrics.
To improve as an organisation, you must measure actionable metrics related to the organisation's goals.

Social impact is typically made up from two components, outputs and outcomes.

_Outputs_ detail what your charity has done or produced. 
For example, how many interventions or workshops you have conducted.
Outputs are easy to measure and are important in understanding your impact as they describe your reach.
However, they are not ideal for learning and improvement as they rarely relate to your goals.
I have yet to meet a charity whose goal was to run workshops, they are just the chosen medium for achieving their desired social change.
Does increasing the number of workshops you run a year improve your charity? 
It may increase your reach, but it does not help inform and measure change.
Outputs are the vanity metrics of social impact.

_Outcomes_ describe the result of your organisation's efforts.
For example, the improvements to a beneficiary's well-being as a result of your intervention.
If the outcomes being measured relate to the organisation's goals, there is scope to learn and improve.
There are many tools available to help define outcomes which contribute towards your goals.
Theory of change is a popular tool, which maps from programs or initiatives, to outcomes and finally your long term-goals.
By following this process, improvements to your outcomes should mean you are improving your ability to achieve your goals.

To be able to learn from your outcomes, you must understand what actions affect them.
For example, if we introduce a new intervention, did it outperform the status quo?
To be able to answer this, your outcome measurement and reporting tool must be capable of reporting on different segments of your data.
Segments are a subset of your data which have similar attributes.
In this example, we could segment our data based on the type of intervention, giving us an insight into how well each performed.
With this capability, organisations can innovate quickly by trialing new approaches and assessing their performance.

To improve as a sector, we must take a leaf from the startup world and focus on actionable metrics.
In the case of social impact, measuring outcomes which are defined based on your goals is a great start.
The next step is to make them actionable, by understanding how your actions affect your outcomes.

Impactasaurus is a simple tool for outcome measuring and reporting.
Data within Impactasaurus can be tagged, allowing reports to be generated for different segments.
