Today we celebrate a huge milestone - Impactasaurus is now available to everyone!

When we started Impactasaurus, almost 2 years ago now, the problem we wanted to solve was — how do small charities monitor and report their impact?

We found the commercial offering at the time were:

-   too expensive
-   only offered to users of a specific CRM system
-   not configurable enough
-   too complicated

so Impactasaurus was born with the simple vision: _for all organisations, benefiting society, to understand their social impact_.

After 10 months of development, we invited our first beta users to start using Impactasaurus.
The aim of the beta was to get feedback from users to make Impactasaurus exactly what they needed.
The beta has ran for 13 months now and has welcomed over 100 organisations.
Through this process we have learnt a lot, leading to the development of many new features within the tool.
We are forever grateful to our kind beta users and thank them for their input.

Impactasaurus addresses the problems we saw 2 years ago: it is free, CRM independent, configurable and easy to use.
Perfect for small to medium sized charities who wish to measure and report their soft outcomes.

Today, Impactasaurus loses its beta status and becomes a fully fledged product.
With this comes a new website, logo and a public [signup page](/signup) so that any organisation can start using the tool.
Although the beta is over, development will continue.
We have many exciting features coming to the system over the coming months.

We’re thrilled to have reached this milestone, and can't wait to share Impactasaurus with all of you.
