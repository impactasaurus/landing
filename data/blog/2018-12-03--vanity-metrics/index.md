Impact is often seen as a counting game. Many charities have impact reports full of quantities: the number of interventions, the number of workshops conducted and the amount of donations received.

The startup world has a term for such stats - vanity metrics. Vanity metrics, in business, cover things like website views, downloads and registered users. On their own, these numbers do not represent impact, merely the activity and interest the company is receiving. As you can guess from the name, they are often used to present the illusion of progress, but don't correlate with business success.

Actionable metrics, on the other hand, are metrics which convey how a business is performing. Conversion and retention rates are a good example, they explain how successful the business is being in terms of gaining new customers and keeping them - both of which are highly correlated with business success.

Combined, vanity and actionable metrics demonstrate how much impact a company is achieving.

Vanity and actionable metrics also apply to charities and the measurement of social impact.

The counts I described at the start of this post are called _outputs_. They detail what your charity has done or produced. These are the vanity metrics of social impact. Don't get me wrong, these numbers are a key component to understanding your impact, but they are only one half of the puzzle. On their own, they merely state what you, as an organisation, have done. Running 20 workshops or engaging with 2000 individuals does not, in itself, mean you had an impact.

_Outcomes_ are the actionable metrics of the social impact world. They describe how successful you were. As an example, an actionable metric may explain if you improved a beneficiary's well-being, or their skills. Actionable metrics get to the core of how well your service is performing. 

Similarly to the business world, to understand impact, outcomes and outputs must be considered together. By combining, you can describe how many people you affect and the success of your intervention.

Let's talk around an example. 

Consider a charity trying to reduce childhood obesity. The charity may decide to tackle the issue by giving lessons to children about healthy eating. 

The number of lessons conducted is the output of the charity. Measuring output is as simple as counting the lessons given.

The charity's goal is to reduce the amount of childhood obesity, this is their desired outcome.  To measure outcome, they could weigh the children when they conduct the lesson and 6 months later, the weight lost is the outcome of their intervention.

If the lessons are not successful in reducing weight, no matter how many workshops the charity ran, they would never have an impact. Conversely, if the lesson lead to significant weight loss, but was only given to a single cohort of children, the charity would not have a large impact. 

Real impact is only realised if the lesson is given to many children and it is successful in reducing their weight.

Clearly, measuring outcomes is much harder than measuring outputs, but it is key to understanding your impact and to improving your service.
