Impactasaurus is used by charities all around the world, but up until recently, we only supported English.

Over the last couple of months we have built a translation system into the app, allowing us to support any left to right language. And thanks to kind volunteers, we have the app translated to Welsh and Portuguese.

The app will automatically translate if your browser is configured for a non English language that we support. You can also select which language you would like to use from your profile page, which is accessed by clicking your initials in the top right, then pressing 'profile'.

We would love to bring free and easy impact reporting to many more countries, so if you are multilingual and want to help, get involved at [translation.impactasaurus.org](https://translation.impactasaurus.org).
